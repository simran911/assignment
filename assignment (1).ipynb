    "1. **Mean**: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing all the data values and dividing the sum by the number of data points. It represents the typical or central value of a dataset and is commonly used to describe the central tendency when the data is approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle one. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is a robust measure of central tendency and is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). If all values occur with the same frequency, the dataset is said to be amodal, and there is no mode. The mode is especially useful for categorical data or discrete data with distinct peaks, where it helps identify the most common category or value.\n",

    "**Mean**:\n",
    "- Definition: The mean is calculated by summing all the data values and dividing the sum by the number of data points.\n",

They provide information about how much the data points deviate from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode) and give us insights into the distribution's scatter or dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Range**:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives a basic idea of the spread but can be influenced by outliers.\n",

It was introduced by the English logician and philosopher John Venn in the late 19th century. Venn diagrams consist of overlapping circles or ellipses, where each circle represents a set or category, and the overlapping regions represent the intersection between those sets.\n",

    "\n",
    "To quantify skewness, various statistical measures can be used, such as the skewness coefficient or the moment coefficient of skewness. However, a visual inspection of a histogram or a plot can often provide an intuitive understanding of the skewness of the data distribution."
